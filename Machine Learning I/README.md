The files in this folder contain code visualziations and a report from my Machine Learning I course. This course investigated parametric and non-parametric supervised and unsupervised machine learning models with focus on Bayesian inference frameworks and neural networks as well as techniques for dimension reduction. 

My term-project used scikit-learn and keras Python packages to compare the performance Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Network models for multi-label classification of variables in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project hospital dataset with use of synthetic resampling techniques to address class imbalance.
