The files in this folder contain code visualziations and a report from my Introduction to Data Mining course. This course explored the use of Python pandas, numpy, and matplotlib packages for cleaning and wrangling multiple data sources, performing numerical operations, and visualizing data. My term-projects focused on demonstrating ability to use packages by analyzing World Bank military spending data and state-level community health and hospital readmissions data from the CDC and CMS.
